## Testing

This website had been tested on different devices such as: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile. 
I used Chrome DevTools to make sure it works on: Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 5/6/7/8, iPad, PC Desktop;

### Throubleshooting:

1. *Navbar*: I had a issue to make the navbar responsive. After watching many videos on youtube to solve the problem I eventually made it work.
2. *Image of the band on the Home page*: The image looked stretched. My mentor help me with it. I applied height and width. 
By removing px from the width and added % - it worked.
3. *Gallery*: Initially I inserted carousel from bootstrap. But the issue was with the images. After makeing them all the same size, they looked stretched
or even smaller than the carousel itself. I removed the carousel. I could not fix the issue.

### To be fixed:

1. *Booking form* : e.g. in the "Name" field an e-mail address is accepted;
